# Forever Autumn - ALPHA Version
## The Invasion from Mars - A New Dark Age Mod
A 'War of the Worlds' mod - with shades of 'Mars Attacks'<br> 
IN DEVELOPMENT - but 1840's start has been tested.

A spin off from 'A New Dark Age'. Can run as a stand alone, but was intend to be run with NDA for added chaos.

Three choices as to where and when they initially land.

1840's England (Early)<br>
1900's England (H G Wells)<br>
1930's Upper New York (Orson Wells)<br>

Can be cheesed by playing as the initial victims so those are best avoided.
